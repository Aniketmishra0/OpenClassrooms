### Programs and Classes
* Bootcamps
  * [The Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele](http://bit.ly/2yEYsoB). I include this paid course because it is worth its weight in gold. Inexpensive (less than $20) and one of the best resources out there. If you're going to buy one course to learn WebDev, buy this one. Also see - [The Advanced Web Dev Bootcamp](http://bit.ly/2z3TnGR)
